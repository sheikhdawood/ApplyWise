# ApplyWise 🤖  
### Intelligent, Trust-Driven Job Application Agent

**ApplyWise** is an autonomous AI-powered job application system that **thinks before it applies**.

Unlike traditional auto-apply bots, ApplyWise evaluates job quality, matches roles against your resume, makes explainable decisions, and only applies when it is **safe, relevant, and trusted** — with full persistence, observability, and human control.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> **Discover broadly → Filter strictly → Decide carefully → Apply selectively**

ApplyWise is built around the idea that **not applying is often the correct action**.

The system remembers every job it has seen and every decision it has made, ensuring:
- No duplicate applications
- No infinite loops
- No blind automation
